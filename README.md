# The Narthenian Conspiracy

When the heavens and the underworld made a joint attack on the people of the earth, the six cities united under the leadership of Carathusia for defense. Narthenus, one of the greatest warriors of the Forest People, disapproved of his people’s decision to submit to Carathusia, and betrayed both his army and the joint army’s battle plans to the underworld. The traitor’s actions nearly brought an end to the world, but under the Carthusian general’s leadership, the six cities managed to save the mortal races.

The unified kingdom lasted for centuries, until four thousand years after the great war, when a cult calling themselves the Narthenians attempted to overthrow the kingdom and break up the rule of the people once again. Civil war lasted for many years until the cult was finally driven out, but not destroyed. The leader of the cult, Tarpeya, fled to the deserts in the north with her few remaining followers. Rumors from the desert city Erimea suggest that the cult has established camp in the western part of the desert.

Although Carathusia’s resources were nearly exhausted after the civil war, the king was troubled by the reported movements of the remaining Narthenians. Concerned that Tarpeya was up to something more than just hiding out, he summoned a young warrior who had distinguished himself in service during the civil war. The young hero was sent to investigate and advised to travel first to Adon, where the dungeon held a former adviser to Tarpeya who may know more about her activities.

## Compiling and Running

The Narthenian Conspiracy uses CMake. At the moment, the partially written game has not been tested on any platform besides FreeBSD. I hope to provide more complete build instructions soon, once the game is a little more feature complete and has been tested on Windows and GNU/Linux.

Currently arrow keys move the player, and ENTER and SPACE act as the action keys. Gamepad support coming soon. Use ESC to quit at any time.
